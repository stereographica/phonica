# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸš¨ MOST CRITICAL RULES

1. **NEVER commit or push directly to main branch** - Always use feature branches and PRs
2. **NEVER commit failing tests** - All tests must pass before committing
3. **NEVER use `--no-verify` flag** unless explicitly instructed by the user
4. **ALWAYS follow TDD** - Write tests before implementation
5. **ALWAYS run E2E tests locally** before pushing to avoid CI failures

## Project Overview
