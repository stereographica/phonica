# Critical Rules to Prevent CI Failures

## üö® MANDATORY Test Execution Before Git Operations

### 1. Before EVERY commit:

- Run `npm test` and ensure ALL tests pass
- Even small changes can break tests (e.g., removing an alert, changing button text)
- NEVER commit with failing tests - fix them first

### 2. Before EVERY push:

- Run full CI simulation locally
- This prevents embarrassing CI failures and saves time
- CI failures block PR merging and delay the entire team

### 3. Common Test-Breaking Changes:

- Removing `alert()` calls ‚Üí Update tests to not expect alerts
- Changing UI text (Japanese ‚Üî English) ‚Üí Update all test assertions
- Modifying API responses ‚Üí Update mock data in tests
- Changing component behavior ‚Üí Update behavioral tests
- Adding/removing form fields ‚Üí Update form submission tests

### 4. Test-First Mindset:

- When changing ANY code, ask: "Which tests might this break?"
- Update tests IMMEDIATELY after changing implementation
- Run tests BEFORE committing, not after CI fails

## üõ°Ô∏è Zero-Tolerance Policy

- **NO EXCUSES**: "I forgot to run tests" is not acceptable
- **NO SHORTCUTS**: "It's a small change" - small changes break tests too
- **NO DELAYS**: Fix test failures immediately, not after pushing

Remember: Every CI failure wastes time, breaks flow, and delays delivery. Test locally, commit confidently.

## Pre-commit Hook Requirements

### üîí MANDATORY Pre-commit Hook Execution

1. **Pre-commit hook exists and MUST pass**:

   - The repository has a pre-commit hook that runs ALL tests
   - You CANNOT commit unless ALL tests pass successfully
   - This includes unit tests, lint, type check, and E2E tests

2. **DO NOT modify or bypass pre-commit hooks**:

   - NEVER delete or modify `.husky/pre-commit` file
   - NEVER reduce the number of tests executed in pre-commit hook
   - NEVER use `--no-verify` flag unless explicitly instructed by the user
   - **Exception**: You MAY use `--no-verify` for changes that don't affect test results (documentation, CI configuration, etc.)

3. **Pre-commit hook execution policy**:

   - **MUST run pre-commit hook**: When changing implementation or tests
   - **MAY skip with `--no-verify`**: Only for documentation, CI configuration, or other non-test-affecting changes
   - **ALWAYS verify**: If unsure whether changes affect tests, run the pre-commit hook

4. **Complete problem resolution**:
   - For ALL test cases, DO NOT skip tests to bypass failures
   - MUST fix all failing tests before committing
   - MUST resolve the root cause of test failures, not work around them
   - If a test is genuinely outdated, update it properly rather than skipping
   - **PROHIBITED**: Skipping test cases because they don't pass
   - **Exception**: If fixing the implementation is better than fixing the test, notify the user of this judgment
